# Social Media Analytics Assignment

I am **Vidhika Rayate** from **TYDS**.

This assignment is based on collecting **Dutch social media collection** data from **Kaggle**, creating a **heatmap** to visualize tweet locations, and generating a **CSV file** using **TextBlob** to classify translated tweet descriptions as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiments.
